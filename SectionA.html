<p>Purdue University is a public land-grant
     research university in West Lafayette, Indiana,
      and the main campus of the Purdue University 
      system. The university was founded in 1869 
      after Lafayette businessman John Purdue donated land and money to establish a college of science,
     technology, and agriculture in his name. -- Wikipedia.</p>
